def prep_data(X, B, win=15):
    """
    Prepares the data for the BundleNet algorithm by formatting the input neuronal and behavioral traces.

    Parameters:
        X : np.ndarray
            Raw neuronal traces of shape (n, t), where n is the number of neurons and t is the number of time steps.
        B : np.ndarray
            Raw behavioral traces of shape (t,), representing the behavioral data corresponding to the neuronal
            traces.
        win : int, optional
            Length of the window to feed as input to the algorithm. If win > 1, a slice of the time series is used 
            as input.

    Returns:
        X_paired : np.ndarray
            Paired neuronal traces of shape (m, 2, win, n), where m is the number of paired windows,
            2 represents the current and next time steps, win is the length of each window,
            and n is the number of neurons.
        B_1 : np.ndarray
            Behavioral traces corresponding to the next time step, of shape (m,). Each value represents
            the behavioral data corresponding to the next time step in the paired neuronal traces.

        X_paired : np.ndarray
            Paired neuronal traces of shape (m, 2, win, n), where m is the number of paired windows,
            2 represents the current and next time steps, win-1 is the length of each window excluding the last time
